<h1>Welcome to VueTraining!</h1>

<p>By the time you're done, you'll be ready to write real-world programs in both Vue 2 and Vue 3.</p>

<p>So let's get you started.</p>

<p>I saw that you already have a VueScreencasts account, so I've modified that account to give you access to VueTraining as well (same backend).

<p>That is, <strong>your VueTraining password is the same as your VueScreencasts password</strong>, and your username is this email address.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.vuetraining.net/vue-training">access the curriculum</a> here.</p>

<p>See you in <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vuetraining/shared_invite/zt-f78q3e13-ChcPkFnXQqNEaJOjOWwF8w">the Slack</a>.</p>
